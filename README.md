## Note:
### I used this for my personal use to copy subscription and copy playlist videos to my second youtube account so the code written is for my use only. 

### I'll try to make it for everyone to use for themself and will add all the instructions how to use it in future. (As I'm not having a laptop currently so i can't modify and change the code currently)
